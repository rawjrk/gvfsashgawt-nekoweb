_Destroy Data, Not People_

Webtooling for animated glitch.

> _This browser has a known bug: flickering while background update. Which ruins animations._

## _what it does_

This tooling does exactly datamosh. Meaning that it does directly manipulate file's binary data and randomized its values on specific bytes.

> _If you are familiar with manual datamosh using hex-editor (or any text editor), this project does exactly that thing, but it's automated in a way that you can get an animation from a sequence of images._

## _what could be controled_

At this point, there are a few inputs:

- datamoshed bytes (from/to): specifies the range where are values randomized
- animation (checkbox): switch on/off animated mode

## _feedback / contacts_
