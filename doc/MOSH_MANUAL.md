## the essence

This tooling does exactly datamosh, i.e. directly manipulating a file's binary data and randomizing its values on specific bytes.

> _You might be familiar with manual datamosh using hex-editor (or any text editor). This project does exactly that thing, and it's automated in a way that you can get an animation from a sequence of images._

## controls-related

At this point, there are a few inputs:

- datamoshed bytes (from/to): specifies the range where values are randomized
- animation (checkbox): switch on/off animated mode
